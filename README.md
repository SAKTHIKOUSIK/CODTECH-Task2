Overview of Task-2: Predictive Modeling with Classification 

Objective:

To build and evaluate predictive models using classification algorithms on a labeled dataset.

Key Steps:

1. Data Preprocessing:     

Handled missing values.
Standardized the features.
Split the data into training and testing sets.

2.Model Training:

Applied various classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

3.Evaluation Metrics:

Assessed models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Generated classification reports for each model.

4.Results: 

• The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model outperformed the others with:
    • Accuracy: 96.67%
    • Precision: 96.97%
    • Recall: 96.67%
    • F1-score: 96.66%

Conclusion:

The SVM model proved to be the most effective for the given dataset, demonstrating high accuracy and balanced performance across all evaluation metrics.
